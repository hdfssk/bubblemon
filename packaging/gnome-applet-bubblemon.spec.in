%description
The Bubbling Load Monitor displays CPU and memory load as a bubbling liquid.

- The water level indicates how much memory is in use.
- The color of the liquid indicates how much swap space is used (watery blue
  means none and angry red means all).
- The system CPU load is indicated by bubbles floating up through the liquid;
  lots of bubbles mean high CPU load. On SMP systems CPU load distribution is
  visualized by having the most heavily loaded CPU's bubbles in the middle and
  the others nearer to the edges.
- Seaweed growing up from the bottom indicate IO load; taller means high load.
- If you have unread mail, a message in a bottle falls into the water. 

Choose "Add to Panel" -> "Bubbling Load Monitor" in your GNOME Panel.
